Don't make a big production, don't make up an elaborate story.  This is to help you avoid a big tear jerking scene.  If you want to hire other people, say so.  Be prepared for that person to feel hurt and rejected.  Even if you've only employed them for a short time and haven't been too serious, there's still a feeling of rejection when a company says they prefer the company of others to one's exclusive company.  But if you are honest and direct and avoid making a flowery, emotional speech when you break the news, that person will respect you for your frankness and honestly he'll appreciate the kind of straight-forward manner in which you told him your decision unless he's a real jerk or a crybaby and doesn't have any friends!\""
